# RaceOn - Desert Bandit Racing Game

A browser-based combat racing game, built with TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas.

## üéÆ Current State

**Desert Justice Mode**: Open-world desert with **water bandits** stealing from precious oases! Ram the blue bandits before they escape with the water. Righteous justice in the wasteland! üíß‚öñÔ∏è

## üöó Development Journey

### Phase 1: Racing Foundations
**Key Commit**: [Initial racing game implementation](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/641bc72)
- Built vehicle physics, track system, and canvas rendering
- Established TypeScript + Vite development environment
- Created oval track with keyboard controls

### Phase 2: Visual Polish  
**Key Commit**: [Implement sprite rendering with smooth rotation](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/11b3f1a)
- Replaced rectangles with pixel art car sprites
- Added smooth rotation and asset management system

### Phase 3: Collision System
**Key Commit**: [Improve track boundaries and collision](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/140f083)
- Added traffic cone boundaries with realistic bounce physics
- Eliminated hard stops for smoother gameplay

### Phase 4: Desert Transformation
**Key Commit**: [Transform to desert bandit open-world game](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/44e7dba)
- **Major pivot**: Removed closed track ‚Üí massive open world (2400x1800)
- Added camera system, water obstacles, procedural desert terrain

### Phase 5: Desert Polish
**Key Commit**: [Fix desert world rendering issues](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/09c3a87)
- Used actual sand sprites, eliminated tile gaps
- Added layered rendering for seamless desert appearance

### Phase 6: Water Bandits! üöóüíß
**Key Commit**: [Add water bandits! Blue cars stealing from oases](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Water bandit AI**: Blue cars spawn near oases and try to escape to map edges
- **Justice system**: Ram bandits to destroy them and stop the theft!
- **Smart spawning**: Bandits appear every 8 seconds near different water holes
- **Collision detection**: Satisfying bandit destruction on impact

### Phase 7: Bandit Physics & Intelligence üß†
**Key Commits**: [Improve bandit AI with realistic physics](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Realistic physics**: Bandits follow same collision rules as player (no more cheating!)
- **Natural movement**: Wandering behavior with speed/turn variations for personality
- **Stuck detection**: Smart avoidance when bandits get trapped by obstacles
- **Water collision**: Bandits bounce off water holes realistically

### Phase 8: Debug Tools & Refinement üõ†Ô∏è
**Key Commits**: [Add godly debug mode](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest) & [Refine bandit behavior](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Godly debug mode**: Press 'D' for visual AI overlay (escape routes, collision boundaries, stuck detection)
- **Smart avoidance**: Strategic obstacle navigation prevents ping-ponging between water holes
- **Proper escapes**: Bandits must reach actual map edges, not escape prematurely
- **Clean HUD**: Streamlined interface showing only essential bandit count

### Phase 9: Immersion & Polish ‚ú®
**Key Commits**: [Add immersive effects system](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest) & [Polish visual feedback](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Screen shake system**: Satisfying camera shake on bandit destruction and water collisions
- **Particle effects**: Destruction debris, water splashes, and realistic dust trails behind vehicles
- **Tire track system**: Visual tracking for both player and bandits with natural fade-out
- **Optimized effects**: Faster track lifecycle eliminates jarring disappearances
- **Cinematic chases**: Both player and bandits leave dust trails for epic pursuit sequences

### Phase 10: Rich Terrain Interaction System üèúÔ∏è
**Key Commits**: [Enhanced terrain generation & collision system](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Immersive terrain variety**: Clumped textured sand patches, natural cactus groves, scattered rock formations
- **Organic water oases**: Dense, realistic water holes with textured sand shorelines for depth
- **Rock collision detection**: Solid obstacles with bounce physics - rocks act like additional barriers
- **Friction-based terrain physics**: Realistic resistance instead of jarring speed changes
- **Textured sand slowdown**: 50% resistance in wet/muddy areas around oases
- **Cactus grove resistance**: 70% resistance in thorny terrain (spines slow you down!)
- **Minimum speed floor**: Never get completely stuck - maintain 20% forward, 10% reverse speed
- **Strategic navigation**: Terrain choice affects performance and route planning

### Phase 11: Configuration-Driven Architecture üîß
**Key Commit**: [Config Integration Complete: All Effect & Physics Values Now Configurable](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Complete config integration**: All hardcoded values replaced with centralized configuration
- **Effect system tuning**: Particle counts, screen shake intensities, tire track settings all configurable
- **Physics customization**: Collision radius multipliers, terrain effects, speed thresholds via config
- **Critical bug fix**: Screen shake blackout issue resolved (decay rate corrected)
- **Rapid iteration**: Easy gameplay balancing without code changes
- **Foundation for upgrades**: Config structure ready for vehicle progression systems
