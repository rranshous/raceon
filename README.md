### Phase 7: Bandit Physics & Intelligence üß†
**Key Commits**: [Improve bandit AI with realistic physics](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Realistic physics**: Bandits follow same collision rules as player (no more cheating!)
- **Natural movement**: Wandering behavior with speed/turn variations for personality
- **Stuck detection**: Smart avoidance when bandits get trapped by obstacles
- **Water collision**: Bandits bounce off water holes realistically

### Phase 8: Debug Tools & Refinement üõ†Ô∏è
**Key Commits**: [Add godly debug mode](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest) & [Refine bandit behavior](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Godly debug mode**: Press 'D' for visual AI overlay (escape routes, collision boundaries, stuck detection)
- **Smart avoidance**: Strategic obstacle navigation prevents ping-ponging between water holes
- **Proper escapes**: Bandits must reach actual map edges, not escape prematurely
- **Clean HUD**: Streamlined interface showing only essential bandit count

### Phase 9: Immersion & Polish ‚ú®
**Key Commits**: [Add immersive effects system](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest) & [Polish visual feedback](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Screen shake system**: Satisfying camera shake on bandit destruction and water collisions
- **Particle effects**: Destruction debris, water splashes, and realistic dust trails behind vehicles
- **Tire track system**: Visual tracking for both player and bandits with natural fade-out
- **Optimized effects**: Faster track lifecycle eliminates jarring disappearances
- **Cinematic chases**: Both player and bandits leave dust trails for epic pursuit sequences

### Phase 10: Rich Terrain Interaction System üèúÔ∏è
**Key Commits**: [Enhanced terrain generation & collision system](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Immersive terrain variety**: Clumped textured sand patches, natural cactus groves, scattered rock formations
- **Organic water oases**: Dense, realistic water holes with textured sand shorelines for depth
- **Rock collision detection**: Solid obstacles with bounce physics - rocks act like additional barriers
- **Friction-based terrain physics**: Realistic resistance instead of jarring speed changes
- **Textured sand slowdown**: 50% resistance in wet/muddy areas around oases
- **Cactus grove resistance**: 70% resistance in thorny terrain (spines slow you down!)
- **Minimum speed floor**: Never get completely stuck - maintain 20% forward, 10% reverse speed
- **Strategic navigation**: Terrain choice affects performance and route planning

### Phase 11: Configuration-Driven Architecture üîß
**Key Commit**: [Config Integration Complete: All Effect & Physics Values Now Configurable](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Complete config integration**: All hardcoded values replaced with centralized configuration
- **Effect system tuning**: Particle counts, screen shake intensities, tire track settings all configurable
- **Physics customization**: Collision radius multipliers, terrain effects, speed thresholds via config
- **Critical bug fix**: Screen shake blackout issue resolved (decay rate corrected)
- **Rapid iteration**: Easy gameplay balancing without code changes
- **Foundation for upgrades**: Config structure ready for vehicle progression systems

### Phase 12: Intelligent Obstacle Avoidance System üß†
**Key Commits**: [Pre-computed spatial grid for AI optimization](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Pre-computed avoidance grid**: 75x75 spatial grid with O(1) obstacle lookups for maximum performance
- **Smart terrain avoidance**: Enemies avoid water holes, rocks, wet sand patches, and cactus groves
- **Performance optimization**: 500ms sampling intervals enable scaling to hundreds of enemies
- **Multiple lookahead points**: 60-140 pixel forward scanning for early obstacle detection
