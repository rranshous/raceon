# RaceOn - Desert Bandit Racing Game

A browser-based combat racing game inspired by Rock 'n Roll Racing, built with TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas.

## üéÆ Current State

**Desert Justice Mode**: Open-world desert with **water bandits** stealing from precious oases! Ram the blue bandits before they escape with the water. Righteous justice in the wasteland! üíß‚öñÔ∏è

## üöó Development Journey

### Phase 1: Racing Foundations
**Key Commit**: [Initial racing game implementation](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/641bc72)
- Built vehicle physics, track system, and canvas rendering
- Established TypeScript + Vite development environment
- Created oval track with keyboard controls

### Phase 2: Visual Polish  
**Key Commit**: [Implement sprite rendering with smooth rotation](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/11b3f1a)
- Replaced rectangles with pixel art car sprites
- Added smooth rotation and asset management system

### Phase 3: Collision System
**Key Commit**: [Improve track boundaries and collision](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/140f083)
- Added traffic cone boundaries with realistic bounce physics
- Eliminated hard stops for smoother gameplay

### Phase 4: Desert Transformation
**Key Commit**: [Transform to desert bandit open-world game](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/44e7dba)
- **Major pivot**: Removed closed track ‚Üí massive open world (2400x1800)
- Added camera system, water obstacles, procedural desert terrain

### Phase 5: Desert Polish
**Key Commit**: [Fix desert world rendering issues](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/09c3a87)
- Used actual sand sprites, eliminated tile gaps
- Added layered rendering for seamless desert appearance

### Phase 6: Water Bandits! üöóüíß
**Key Commit**: [Add water bandits! Blue cars stealing from oases](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Water bandit AI**: Blue cars spawn near oases and try to escape to map edges
- **Justice system**: Ram bandits to destroy them and stop the theft!
- **Smart spawning**: Bandits appear every 8 seconds near different water holes
- **Collision detection**: Satisfying bandit destruction on impact

### Phase 7: Bandit Physics & Intelligence üß†
**Key Commits**: [Improve bandit AI with realistic physics](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Realistic physics**: Bandits follow same collision rules as player (no more cheating!)
- **Natural movement**: Wandering behavior with speed/turn variations for personality
- **Stuck detection**: Smart avoidance when bandits get trapped by obstacles
- **Water collision**: Bandits bounce off water holes realistically

### Phase 8: Debug Tools & Refinement üõ†Ô∏è
**Key Commits**: [Add godly debug mode](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest) & [Refine bandit behavior](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Godly debug mode**: Press 'D' for visual AI overlay (escape routes, collision boundaries, stuck detection)
- **Smart avoidance**: Strategic obstacle navigation prevents ping-ponging between water holes
- **Proper escapes**: Bandits must reach actual map edges, not escape prematurely
- **Clean HUD**: Streamlined interface showing only essential bandit count

### Phase 9: Immersion & Polish ‚ú®
**Key Commits**: [Add immersive effects system](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest) & [Polish visual feedback](https://github.com/rranshous/raceon/commit/latest)
- **Screen shake system**: Satisfying camera shake on bandit destruction and water collisions
- **Particle effects**: Destruction debris, water splashes, and realistic dust trails behind vehicles
- **Tire track system**: Visual tracking for both player and bandits with natural fade-out
- **Optimized effects**: Faster track lifecycle eliminates jarring disappearances
- **Cinematic chases**: Both player and bandits leave dust trails for epic pursuit sequences

## üéØ What We've Built

- **Smooth vehicle physics** with realistic driving feel
- **Asset-based rendering** using pixel art sprite sheets  
- **Open desert world** with procedural terrain generation
- **Water obstacle collision** with bounce physics
- **Camera system** for world exploration
- **Water bandit AI** - blue cars stealing from oases with intelligent escape behavior
- **Justice collision system** - ram bandits to stop water theft!
- **Smart obstacle avoidance** - bandits navigate around water holes strategically
- **Visual debug tools** - godly mode overlay for development and analysis
- **Realistic AI physics** - bandits follow same rules as player (no cheating!)
- **Immersive effects system** - screen shake, particles, dust trails, and tire tracks
- **Visual bandit tracking** - follow tire tracks to hunt down escaping water thieves
- **Cinematic feedback** - every collision and action has satisfying visual impact
- **Modular architecture** ready for expansion

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

**Godly Debug Mode** - Press 'D' to toggle comprehensive visual debugging:
- **AI Visualization**: See bandit escape routes, avoidance paths, and decision-making
- **Collision Boundaries**: Visual representation of water obstacles and collision radii
- **State Indicators**: Color-coded bandit states (normal/avoiding/stuck)
- **Performance Metrics**: Bandit counts, escape progress, and system stats
- **World Overview**: Camera-independent overlay perfect for development and analysis

## Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Vite** - Fast build tooling and hot reload
- **HTML5 Canvas** - 2D rendering and animation
- **Pixel Art Assets** - Authentic retro aesthetic

## üé® Assets

Using the ["Mini Pixel Pack 2"](https://grafxkid.itch.io/mini-pixel-pack-2) by GrafxKid for authentic pixel art styling including cars, desert details, and environmental elements.
