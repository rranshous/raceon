work to keep cyclic dependencies low, and to make it easy to add new features without touching existing code.
keep files small and focused on a single responsibility
update the README journey section to reflect major milestones
use computer science terms in discussion
seperate concerns - keep physics, rendering, AI, and game logic modular
prefer to create a new module rather than adding many lines to an existing file
