# Rock 'n Roll Racing: Spiritual Successor Game Design Document

**Core Vision**: Create a modern browser-based combat racing game that captures the addictive progression, balanced combat, and "easy to learn, difficult to master" philosophy that made Rock 'n Roll Racing a classic.

## Game Overview

### Core Concept
**4-player isometric combat racing** where players advance through increasingly challenging planetary racing leagues by earning money to upgrade vehicles and weapons. **Racing success depends equally on driving skill and tactical weapon usage**, with **instant respawn after destruction** maintaining constant action while **economic progression** provides long-term motivation.

### Essential Design Pillars
1. **Balanced Combat-Racing** - Neither pure racing nor pure combat dominates
2. **Meaningful Progression** - Every race earns resources for tangible improvements  
3. **Instant Accessibility** - Simple controls, clear objectives, immediate fun
4. **Strategic Depth** - Vehicle/weapon combinations create diverse playstyles
5. **Competitive Tension** - AI that scales with player capabilities

## Core Gameplay Loop

### Race Structure
- **4 contestants per race** (1-2 players + AI opponents)
- **4 laps per race** with **weapon/boost refill each lap**
- **Isometric perspective** enabling **elevation awareness** (jumps, hills, dips)
- **Instant respawn** after destruction (3-4 second delay)
- **Track hazards** specific to planet themes (lava, ice, oil slicks, etc.)

### Victory Conditions
**Placement-based rewards encourage both racing and combat:**
- **1st Place**: 400 points + $10,000
- **2nd Place**: 200 points + $7,000  
- **3rd Place**: 100 points + $4,000
- **4th Place**: 0 points + $0

**Bonus money opportunities:**
- **Destruction bonus**: $1,000 per opponent eliminated
- **Lapping bonus**: $5,000 for lapping any opponent
- **Track pickups**: $1,000 per money item collected

## Progression Systems

### League Structure
**Planet-based advancement** with **division system** creating natural difficulty curves:

1. **Division B** → Earn required points → **Division A** → Earn required points → **Next Planet**
2. **Failure consequence**: Repeat division with 0 points but **retain money/upgrades**
3. **Optional continuation**: Can race extra Division B/A races for additional money

### Difficulty Scaling
**Three skill levels** determining **AI competence** and **content access:**
- **Rookie**: 3 planets accessible, basic AI tactics
- **Veteran**: 5 planets accessible, moderate AI aggression  
- **Warrior**: All 6 planets accessible, advanced AI strategies

### Character Selection
**6 base characters** with **dual attribute bonuses** affecting vehicle performance:
- **Attributes**: Acceleration, Top Speed, Cornering, Jumping
- **Strategic choice**: Speed specialists vs. control specialists vs. balanced builds
- **Hidden character**: Unlockable character with bonuses in multiple attributes

## Vehicle and Upgrade Systems

### Vehicle Progression
**Clear upgrade path** with **meaningful trade-offs:**

1. **Starter Vehicles** ($18,000-20,000)
   - **Dirt Devil**: Better handling, lower speed
   - **Marauder**: Higher speed, looser handling

2. **Mid-Game Vehicle** ($70,000)
   - **Air Blade**: Significant performance upgrade over starters

3. **Specialized Vehicles** ($110,000-130,000)
   - **Battle Trak**: Ignores terrain, no tire upgrades needed
   - **Havac**: Hovercraft ignoring all terrain, limited upgrade options

### Equipment Upgrade Categories
**Four upgrade categories** with **multiple tiers** each:

1. **Engines** - Acceleration and top speed ($40,000-$110,000)
2. **Armor** - Health/durability increase ($25,000-$90,000)  
3. **Tires** - Cornering improvement ($30,000-$85,000)
4. **Shocks** - Jump/landing performance ($20,000-$70,000)

**Strategic consideration**: **All upgrades lost when purchasing new vehicle**, creating economic planning decisions.

### Weapon Systems
**Three weapon categories** with **ammunition-based upgrades:**

#### Forward Weapons (Offensive)
- **Plasma Rifles**: Basic energy projectiles
- **Rogue Missiles**: High damage, slower firing
- **Sundog Beams**: Homing capability, moderate damage
