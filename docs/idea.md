# Idea

I really loved the game rock and roll racing.

I'd like to see how easily we can create a similar racing game.

# Context

Expiremental, joyful, work exploring what we can do together.

This is explorative. This is not production work.

# Technical Guidance

It is easiest for me to play a browser based game.

I do not want more than one backend server. All backend functionality should live in one server.

Typescript please.

Try to put everything in the client. I want a fat client and thin backend.

Use HTML5 Canvas for rendering the game.

# Resource Guidance

If we need resources like sprites or sounds I can find free ones online.

# Vision

Starting simple. Get a very simple one player racing simulation with me as the only player.

Prove we can make something like a racing game and move up from there.

# Collaboration

You and I (Robby and Claude) are working together w/in VSCode.

We are collaborating on this project.

We are both creators of the game and both our input and ideas are valued.
